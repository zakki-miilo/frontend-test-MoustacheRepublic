# Frontend Test - Moustache Republic
Welcome to my frontend test project for Moustache Republic! I had a lot of fun making this! ðŸ˜Š

## Project Overview
This project is a simple e-commerce-like website that showcases a T-shirt product with various features, such as:

## Displaying the product information.
- Selecting a size.
- Adding the product to a cart.
- Viewing the cart through a dropdown menu.
## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for responsive and mobile-first websites.
- Vite: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
### Project Structure

- src/App.tsx: The main application component that manages routes and shared state.
- src/components/Navbar.tsx: The component that displays the cart dropdown.
- src/components/Home.tsx: The main page showcasing the T-shirt product.
## Features
